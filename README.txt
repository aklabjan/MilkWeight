Instructions:Begin by entering the filePath to the folder that contains the .csv files.
Entire the year of the data that the folder contains. Then select the report you are looking to obtain.

Bugs/Future Works:
If the correct year is not entered in the year textfield on the welcome scene then no data will upload from file, but will allow user to continue onto reports and say no data to display.

Add insert/remove/edit function to program. Functions already written just need to add to GUI.
